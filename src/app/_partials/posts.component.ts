Click here to read more.","post":"Astralis 1 has scored their second LAN title of the year. In the finals of IEM Katowice 2017, the ELEAGUE Major winners have beaten FaZe Clan with the score of 3-1. However, that match was far from an easy one, as the European mix of FaZe Clan showed a very good resistance.\r\n\r\nThe rivalry between Astralis and FaZe Clan started in the group stage, since both of the teams were placed in the group A. Following the round-robin format, the group A saw a three-team tie, where Astralis, FaZe Clan and Immortals all finished with the score of 4-1. Eventually, they had to play the tiebreakers to determine the final order of the teams going to the playoffs. In the end, FaZe Clan was better than Astralis and Immortals, taking the first seed, while Astralis defeated Immortals for the second seed.\r\n\r\nThe playoffs were once again a very interesting to watch. Same as in Atlanta, Astralis was matched up against Natus Vincere in the quarter-finals. This match was arguably considered as the finals before the finals. However, we couldn\u2019t really agree with that, as Na\u2019Vi didn\u2019t really show their A-game and Astralis have just easily walked past them to score an easy 2-0 win.\r\n\r\nAs we moved to the next round of the playoffs, Astralis were to meet their countrymen from Heroic. Surprisingly, Heroic has topped the group B, leaving the likes such as North, Na\u2019Vi, Virtus.pro, Cloud9 and SK Gaming below them. That being said, this match couldn\u2019t be considered as an easy one and therefore Astralis had to show their top game in order to secure the spot in the grand finals. As the match started, it was perfectly clear that Astralis came to this duel hungry for the win. The first map was considered as a warm-up, however, the second one saw the true stomp in the first half. In the end, the both maps went towards Astralis\u2019 way with the same score of 16-12.\r\n\r\nIn the grand finals, Astralis had to meet FaZe Clan, a team which have beaten them in a tiebreaker of the group A. This was the first tournament for FaZe Clan with this lineup, since they have just finished the acquisition of Nikola \u201cNiKo\u201d Kova\u010d, who became the most paid CS:GO player of all-time. The match didn\u2019t really start as Astralis would have expected. FaZe have quickly gained the lead and maintained it until the very end of the first map which was played on de_cache. The second map started in the same fashion, FaZe showed a very strong CT side on de_overpass, winning it 9-6. However, in the second half, the Danes have finally joined the battlefield. In just a few minutes of the time, they showed why they were the winners of the most recent major. The second map went to Astralis\u2019 favor with the score of 16-12. As the score was tied, we were about to go to the third map, de_nuke, which was the map of FaZe\u2019s choice. Honestly, it was a surprise to see FaZe going for this map and not some other one, as we know how good is Astralis on this particular map. However, FaZe probably wanted to pull some trick out from their sleeve, which eventually didn\u2019t work out. Astralis took this map with the similar score to the previous one, 16-12, and they were just one step away from winning the whole series. The fourth map was played on de_inferno, which was Astralis\u2019 pick. FaZe once again started with a solid CT side, winning 9 rounds on it. However, they couldn\u2019t translate that lead into the win, as the European mix were looking really clueless on their T side, allowing Astralis to close this map out with the 16-13 scoreline.\r\n\r\nWith this win, Astralis have proven that they are indeed the best team in the world. If anything, they are definitely the team with the widest map pool in the whole scene, which allows them to play against anyone without being scared what the map draft will bring to them. On the other hand, it seems that Virtus.pro\u2019s run at ELEAGUE Major and DreamHack Las Vegas was just a short stint, and it seems questionable whether the Poles can repeat the same success in 2017. However, one of the most pleasant surprises of this tournament is surely FaZe Clan. The European mix which wasn\u2019t together even for a four days before the tournament started, showed an excellent performance which can definitely place them into the top tier of the current scene. However, the question remains whether karrigan, NiKo and the guys can repeat the same level of the game in the upcoming challenges? \r\n","author_id":9,"client_id":1,"type":3,"is_draft":0,"published_at":"2017-03-07 09:31:49","created_at":"2017-03-07 09:31:38","updated_at":"2017-03-13 09:29:20","is_highlight":1,"languages":[],"games":[{"id":3,"name":"Counter-Strike: GO","slug":"csgo"}]},

As the score was tied, we were about to go to the third map, de_nuke, which was the map of FaZe\u2019s choice. Honestly, it was a surprise to see FaZe going for this map and not some other one, as we know how good is Astralis on this particular map. However, FaZe probably wanted to pull some trick out from their sleeve, which eventually didn\u2019t work out. Astralis took this map with the similar score to the previous one, 16-12, and they were just one step away from winning the whole series. The fourth map was played on de_inferno, which was Astralis\u2019 pick. FaZe once again started with a solid CT side, winning 9 rounds on it. However, they couldn\u2019t translate that lead into the win, as the European mix were looking really clueless on their T side, allowing Astralis to close this map out with the 16-13 scoreline.\r\n\r\nWith this win, Astralis have proven that they are indeed the best team in the world. If anything, they are definitely the team with the widest map pool in the whole scene, which allows them to play against anyone without being scared what the map draft will bring to them. On the other hand, it seems that Virtus.pro\u2019s run at ELEAGUE Major and DreamHack Las Vegas was just a short stint, and it seems questionable whether the Poles can repeat the same success in 2017. However, one of the most pleasant surprises of this tournament is surely FaZe Clan. The European mix which wasn\u2019t together even for a four days before the tournament started, showed an excellent performance which can definitely place them into the top tier of the current scene. However, the question remains whether karrigan, NiKo and the guys can repeat the same level of the game in the upcoming challenges? \r\n","author_id":9,"client_id":1,"type":3,"is_draft":0,"published_at":"2017-03-07 09:31:49","created_at":"2017-03-07 09:31:38","updated_at":"2017-03-13 09:29:20","is_highlight":0,"languages":[],"games":[{"id":3,"name":"Counter-Strike: GO","slug":"csgo"}]},

However, that match was far from an easy one, as the European mix of FaZe Clan showed a very good resistance.\r\n\r\nThe rivalry between Astralis and FaZe Clan started in the group stage, since both of the teams were placed in the group A. Following the round-robin format, the group A saw a three-team tie, where Astralis, FaZe Clan and Immortals all finished with the score of 4-1. Eventually, they had to play the tiebreakers to determine the final order of the teams going to the playoffs. In the end, FaZe Clan was better than Astralis and Immortals, taking the first seed, while Astralis defeated Immortals for the second seed.\r\n\r\nThe playoffs were once again a very interesting to watch. Same as in Atlanta, Astralis was matched up against Natus Vincere in the quarter-finals. This match was arguably considered as the finals before the finals. However, we couldn\u2019t really agree with that, as Na\u2019Vi didn\u2019t really show their A-game and Astralis have just easily walked past them to score an easy 2-0 win.\r\n\r\nAs we moved to the next round of the playoffs, Astralis were to meet their countrymen from Heroic. Surprisingly, Heroic has topped the group B, leaving the likes such as North, Na\u2019Vi, Virtus.pro, Cloud9 and SK Gaming below them. That being said, this match couldn\u2019t be considered as an easy one and therefore Astralis had to show their top game in order to secure the spot in the grand finals. As the match started, it was perfectly clear that Astralis came to this duel hungry for the win. The first map was considered as a warm-up, however, the second one saw the true stomp in the first half. In the end, the both maps went towards Astralis\u2019 way with the same score of 16-12.\r\n\r\nIn the grand finals, Astralis had to meet FaZe Clan, a team which have beaten them in a tiebreaker of the group A. This was the first tournament for FaZe Clan with this lineup, since they have just finished the acquisition of Nikola \u201cNiKo\u201d Kova\u010d, who became the most paid CS:GO player of all-time. The match didn\u2019t really start as Astralis would have expected. FaZe have quickly gained the lead and maintained it until the very end of the first map which was played on de_cache.
