# Coding Standards

We use [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) coding standard and [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) autoload standard. Please, find the time to get familiar with them and start writing your code in this fashion. In the long term this would help us to:

* Improve code maintainability and scalability.
* Improve code quality. In particular: testability, supportability, portability, security, efficiency, robustness, high cohesion/loose coupling.
* Improve development speed. You don't need to make all decisions starting from first principles.
* Have better teamwork.
* Make it quicker and easier for a developer to move to a different project or team.
* Produce fewer bugs. Good standards should minimize common coding mistakes.
* Make a shallower learning curve and useful training for new hires.

**Legacy code will not be refactored to fit the coding standards**


# Code reviews

We strongly encourage the code review practice. This means that when you are finished with a task, you should create a pull request and assign at least one reviewer to it (other then yourself). **You should only self-merge pull requests if this bug is critical.** Pull requests to the **master** branch can only be reviewed/merged by the lead developer.

Why performing code reviews is a good practice:

* You can find and fix defects early.
* It presents good mentoring/training/learning/team building, especially for new hires.
* It gives broader experience to team members.
* Makes it easier for one team member to maintain another's code.
* Improve overall quality of the code.
* Enforce coding standards.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
